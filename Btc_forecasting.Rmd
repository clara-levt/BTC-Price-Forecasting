## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
library(fpp3)
library(knitr)
library(quantmod)
library(timeSeries)
library(tseries)
library(xts)
library(zoo)
library(gridExtra)
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))
library(tidyverse)
library(tibbletime)
library(ggfortify)
library(TSstudio)
```

```{r}
getSymbols('BTC-USD', from="2018-01-01") 
btc=`BTC-USD`$`BTC-USD.Close`
#Data from yahoo is already processed to xts object
```


```{r}
colnames(btc) <- c('close_price')
```

```{r}
plot(btc)
```
```{r}
#convert everything to everything
library(tsbox)
btc.tsibble <- ts_tsibble(btc)
```

```{r}
#Decomposition of data
fill_gaps(btc.tsibble)
dcmp <- btc.tsibble %>% model(stl = STL(value))

components(dcmp) %>% autoplot()

```

The seasonal component is not really usefull for daily timeseries. The remainder looks pretty the same as the BTC price

```{r}
components(dcmp) %>%
  as_tsibble() %>%
  autoplot(value, colour="gray") +
  geom_line(aes(y=trend), colour = "#D55E00") +
  labs(
    y = "BTC price",
    title = "BTC price with trendline"
  )
```
Moving average is a good tool for price discovery, for which we will calculate long-term and short-term moving average. The long-term moving average is MA99 while the short-term moving average is MA25.

```{r}
library(slider)
btc$MA25= slide_dbl(btc$close_price, mean, .before = 12, .after = 12, .complete = TRUE)
btc$MA99= slide_dbl(btc$close_price, mean, .before = 49, .after = 49, .complete = TRUE)
```

```{r}
btc %>%
  autoplot('close_price') +
  geom_line(aes(y = `MA25`), colour = "green") +
  geom_line(aes(y = `MA99`), colour = "blue") +
  labs(y = "BTC price in USD",
       title = "BTC price + moving average") +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "series"))
```
Autocorrelation 
```{r}
btc.tsibble %>% ACF(value) %>% 
  autoplot() + labs(subtitle = "BTC closing  price")
btc.tsibble %>% ACF(difference(value)) %>% 
  autoplot() + labs(subtitle = "Changes in BTC closing price")

```
```{r}
btc.tsibble %>%  mutate(diff_close = difference(value)) %>% features(diff_close, ljung_box, lag = 10)
```
Since the p-value is significant at lag of 10, we rejects the null hypothesis that the time series isnâ€™t autocorrelated.

```{r}
btc.tsibble %>%  mutate(diff_close = difference(value)) %>% features(diff_close, ljung_box, lag = 1)
```

```{r}
fit <- btc.tsibble %>% model(ARIMA(value))
report(fit)
```

```{r}
fit %>% forecast(h=100) %>%
  autoplot(btc.tsibble) +
  labs(y = "BTC price in USD", title = "BTC forecasting")

```



```{r}
training <- btc[1:1500]
testing <- btc[1501:1650]
```

```{r}
test.tsibble = ts_tsibble(testing)
train.tsibble = ts_tsibble(training)
```

```{r}
fit.train <- train.tsibble %>% model(ARIMA(value))
report(fit.train)
```
```{r}
fit.train %>% forecast(h=100) %>%
  autoplot(train.tsibble) +
  labs(y = "BTC price in USD", title = "BTC forecasting")
line(test.tsibble$value)
```


```{r}
#Decomposition of apple stock price
apple.de.add = decompose(apple, type = "additive")
apple.de.mul = decompose(apple, type =  "multiplicative")
plot(apple.de.add)
plot(apple.de.mul)
```
